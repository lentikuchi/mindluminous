                 <h3>Important Things to Remember</h3>
                 <p>Before you start your fitness program, it is important to know
                  your fitness level, if you have any health conditions or injuries,
                  and your goals. Here are some important things i listed for you to keep in mind:</p>
 
                 <p>Start slowly: It's important for you to start slowly and gradualy increase
                 the intensity and duration of your workouts over time. This will help you to 
                 avoid injury and prevent burnout.</p>
 
                 <p>Warmup and cool down a bit: Keep in mind that you should always warmup
                    before any exercise performed. Let's say after your good workout you

                 <p>Listen to your body: I want you to pay attention to how your body feels
                  during an exercise or after an exercise. Throughout your workouts keep good
                 form and adjust your workouts accordingly.</p>
 
                 <p>Stay hydrated: If you want the full benefits of your self improvement/fitness
                 journey, drink plenty of water wether it's before your workout, after, or even during
                 keep in mind that you must stay hydrated at all costs.</p>
 
                 <p>Get enough rest: It's important to rest between sets so you may get the full effect
                  of the workout. Did i note that you need to take rest days aswell? Its important to 
                 take rest days as your body needs time to repair and get stronger.</p>
